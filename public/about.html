<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is shyam ajay nimje, I was born and raised in Wani , and I am currently a senior at KITS College Ramtek . I am interested in pursuing a degree in UG at RTM nagpur university .
<p>During my college years, I took an interest in coading and programming. In fact, I continuously took classes in DSA, AI & ML, DBMS   because I wanted to challenge myself and learn more. In addition, I have gained skills such as problem-solving, time management, and leadership from extracurricular activities, such as group leadership, project management, multitasking. I value these skills because I strongly believe they will help me be successful in my academic pursuits in preferred subject .</p>
<p>I used my time management skills to also work on my hobbies and interests. Some of my hobbies include coading, photo editing, weight lifting. When I am not involved in my academic responsibilities, I am usually cook .</p>
<p>I want to mention that creativity* and critical thinking* are two of my greatest strengths, which I can use both in real life as well in professional or academic settings. Up until now, they have been a great help to my accomplishments. One weakness Iâ€™d like to mention is flexibility*. I need some time to adjust to abrupt changes in plans. However, I am working hard to turn this weakness into a strength, by exposing myself to situations where I need to adapt quickly.</p>
<p> I am thrilled to continue my academic interests at RTM nagpur univercity. I am also certain that my skills, enthusiasm, and work ethic will make me a strong candidate , Thank you .</p>
